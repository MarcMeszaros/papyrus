INTRODUCTION
------------

This applications enables users to create a virtual library of all the books
they own. Users can also keep track of loans they make to other people.

FEATURES
------------

Papyrus enables the user to track all the physical books they own. They can add
books in a variety of ways. The easiest way is to use the barcode scanning
functionality to scan the ISBN barcode.

To prevent largge amounts of data entry, Papyrus attempts to get the book
information from the Google Books service.

Multiple libraries are supported by Papyrus and so are multiple copies of books.
This feature gives the user finer grained control over how they manage their
books.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Create a project inside Eclipse with the source code and build the .apk

2. Load the .apk onto the phone.

3. Initiate the .apk install ("Unknow sources" needs to be enabled in settings).

Note: The install instructions a sparce because it is assumed the developper
knows how to build and install the .apk from source. More information about
building packages can be found at http://developer.android.com/

CAVEATS
------------

Some gotchas:

 * There is no ANT build file to allow the project to be built via the command
   line. This is a planned feature for a future release.

 * An external library to access the Google Books data is used and doesn't yet
   have a stable release.
